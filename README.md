Spare some time to read this and make sure to peep into our work design. Trust us, you won't regret it!🤔

 
# <p align="center"> Metagenomic data analysis to detect antimicrobial resistance gene
We replicated the galaxy tutorial for the detection of antibiotic resistance: https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/tutorial.html
  
+ **Objective of the work:**
  * Perform Quality control on your reads
  * Assemble the genome
  * Determine the structure of the genome(s)
  * Determine the presence of potential antibiotic resistance genes.
  
Prerequisites: Create your account in Galaxy Europe server. (https://usegalaxy.eu/login)
  
## Step 0 - Preparing data
  
We used 8 samples from an original study (Li, R., M. Xie, N. Dong, D. Lin, X. Yang et al., 2018). Efficient generation of complete sequences of MDR-encoding plasmids by rapid assembly of MinION barcoding sequencing data. In the experiment, 12 MDR plasmid-bearing bacterial strains were selected for plasmid extraction, including E. coli, S. typhimurium, V. parahaemolyticus, and K. pneumoniae.

## Step 1 -  Creating a history and building a list collection for the given datasets by importing those datasets in history

* Open your workspace in Galaxy. Make sure that you have an empty analysis history, Give it a name / Create a new history.
* Click the new-history icon at the top of the history panel. If the new-history is missing: Click on the galaxy-gear icon (History options) on the top of the history panel. Select the option Create New from the menu.
* Download the data on your pc from 
https://zenodo.org/record/3247504#.YRrL_IgzbIV
And upload
Or,
Import via links

Open the Galaxy Upload Manager (galaxy-upload on the top-right of the tool panel) and Select Paste/Fetch Data and copy those above link to retreive input data.<br />
(Tips: Creating a dataset collection - Click on Operations on multiple datasets (check box icon) at the top of the history panel > Check all the datasets in your history you would like to include > Click For all selected and choose Build dataset list > Enter a name for your collection > Click Create List to build your collection > Click on the checkmark icon at the top of your history again.)

## Step 2 - Quality Control: using NanoPlot tool to explore the datasets
- Search for Nanoplot Tool in the search box present on the left side:<br />
	
```
Set Parameters: Select "multifile mode” to batch
“Type of the file(s) to work on” to fasta 
“files” to  The Plasmids dataset collection you had created.
Click Execute.
```
## Step 3 - De-novo Assembly: Pairwise alignment using Map with minimap2 tool
- Search for Map with minimap2 Tool in the search box present on the left side:
```
Set Parameters:
Select 
“Will you select a reference genome from your history or use a built-in index?” to Use a genome from history and build index
“Use the following data collection as the reference sequence” to Plasmids dataset collection you had created.
“Single or Paired-end reads” to Single
“Select fastq dataset” to The Plasmids dataset collection
“Select a profile of preset options” to Oxford Nanopore all-vs-all overlap mapping
In the section Set advanced output options: “Select an output format” to paf
Click Execute.
```
## Step 4 - Ultrafast de novo assembly: using Miniasm tool
- Search for Miniasm Tool in the search box present on the left side:
```
Set Parameters:
Select
“Sequence Reads” to The Plasmids dataset collection
“PAF file” to Output Minimap dataset collection created by Minimap2 tool
Click Execute.
```
## Step 5 - Remapping: First convert the Assembly Graph (collection) created previously by Miniasm using GFA to Fasta tool then perform pairwise sequence alignment again using Map with minimap2 tool

- Search for GFA to Fasta Tool in the search box present on the left side:
```
Set Parameters:
Select
“Input GFA file” to the Assembly Graph (collection) created by Miniasm
Click Execute. 
```
- Search for Map with minimap2 Tool in the search box present on the left side:
```
Set Parameters:
Select
“Will you select a reference genome from your history or use a built-in index?” to Use a genome from history and build index
“Use the following dataset as the reference sequence” to FASTA file output from GFA to Fasta tool (collection)
“Single or Paired-end reads” to single
“Select fastq dataset” to The Plasmids collection
“Select a profile of preset options” to PacBio/Oxford Nanopore read to reference mapping (-Hk19)
