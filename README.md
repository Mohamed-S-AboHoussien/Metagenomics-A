Spare some time to read this and make sure to peep into our work design. Trust us, you won't regret it!ðŸ¤”
  
  
we used 8 samples from an original study.(Li, R., M. Xie, N. Dong, D. Lin, X. Yang et al., 2018 Efficient generation of complete sequences of MDR-encoding plasmids by rapid assembly of MinION barcoding sequencing data. In the experiment, 12 MDR plasmid-bearing bacterial strains were selected for plasmid extraction, including E. coli, S. typhimurium, V. parahaemolyticus, and K. pneumoniae.

**Instructions will be added soon!!**

  
  
  
 

Thank you for your patience and time!
Have a great day!ðŸ¤—
