## Bonjour from Team Metagenomics Group A! :handshake:

Spare some time to read this and make sure to peep into our work design. Trust us, you won't regret it!ðŸ¤”

Before we start. We want to ask you some questions. Do you know why microbes are so important? ðŸ¤”
Though, we can't see them through our normal eyes, still they hold an important place in this world. Why?ðŸ¤”

Are you going to say that they are important because they are the oldest inhabitants of this planet or are very popular as they are found everywhere? :sweat_smile:
No that's not the only reason :no_entry_sign:
Even if they are everywhere from the deep sea vents to the cold ice caps of Antarctica!:sparkles:
They are important because our very own wellbeing is dependent on them. There are millions of these tiny creatures present in our skin, gut, intestine etc. :microbe:
When they are happy, you and your health are happy. When they are provoked or distured then be prepared to rush to a doctor dear :runner:

Then how can we study them? Follow the old rules : Culture them and observe. Nah, that's not always a good idea because not all bacterial species are culturable. Many need special conditions to thrive. ThenðŸ¤” Don't worry, we live in the 21st century! :partying_face: And here comes this amazing field named 'Metagenomics'!ðŸŒŸ

Due to the advancement in sequencing technologies, we can now directly collect samples from different environments and sequence it in one go. Then the data that you have obtained can help you to analyse, characterize, and predict the microbial population with their role in that environment.:raised_hands:

Now, let us tell you an interesting insight about microbes. 'They are super intelligent'. Yes, you heard it right. We know they don't have brains like us but they don't need that. They have something that can make them a superbug! Some powers just like superman! Sounds interesting, isn't it? These powers come from something known as 'plasmids'. This is not just all, they believe in sharing these powers too! Plasmids can help them to survive in conditions where their life is at stake.:v:

Plasmids are useful and good for them but for humans they are a matter of concern. :fearful: But hold on, the reason lies back in history and it is we the homo sapiens, who have paved the way for what we call is 'Antibiotic resistance'. :pleading_face:

The growing misuse and excessive use of antibiotics prescribed by physicians in the past have provided microbes an opportunity to evolve into multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria, through this plasmid power. Now, the concern is that we don't have an alternative solution to tackle this. In many bacterial diseases, we need to use antibiotics but if they become resistant then the antibiotic won't work. :pill::x:

Researchers and Scientists throughout the world are working day and night to study the mechanism of this resistance and trying hard to come up with solutions to tackle this problem. The one solution may be to use antibiotics wisely. But for the long run, we need a permanent solution and for finding so we need to identify the different antimicrobial resistance genes currently present. Hence, careful characterization of plasmids and other multidrug resistant mobile genetic elements is vital for understanding their evolution and transmission and adaptation to new hosts. :writing_hand:

Oops! I know this was way too long :eyes: But the main purpose to explain this was to make you understand the purpose of our work. The design attached with this long passage is a representation of the steps that we need to complete to find some of these powerful genes! :nerd_face:


Thank you for your patience and time!
Have a great day!ðŸ¤—
